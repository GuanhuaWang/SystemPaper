# Tux: Distributed Graph Computation for Machine Learning

1. SSP (stale synchronous processing)

2. Hetergeneous object (i.e. vertex) for data compression & less network traffic...

It is a good insight. For customer recommendation, items are high degree vertex, whereas users are low degree vertex. Therefore, scan items will reduce less random memory access.
