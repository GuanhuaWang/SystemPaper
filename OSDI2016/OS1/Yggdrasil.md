#Push-Button Verification of File Systems via Crash Refinement

##Problem

File system verfication is hard to prove (takes manually in years)
=> Yggdrasil produce a counter example if there is a bug. No need proof.

##How it works
'Crash Refinement': capture non-determinism bugs (e.g. reordering of writes)
Crash Refinement

##Strength
* counter-example based debugging is better than Proof
