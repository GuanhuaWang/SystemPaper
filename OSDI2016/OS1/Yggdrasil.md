#Push-Button Verification of File Systems via Crash Refinement

##Problem

File system verfication is hard to prove (takes manually in years)

=> Yggdrasil produce a counter example if there is a bug. No need proof.

##How it works
`Crash Refinement`: capture non-determinism bugs (e.g. reordering of writes)

`Crash Refinement` is achieved by a *satisfiablility modulo theories* (SMT) solver (Z3).

Speicificaition => SMT problem solver: 

To make SMT a push-button solution => *layering*

exhausting all execution path within a layer, avoiding path explosion between layers.

##How to use it
input: `specification` , `implementation`,`consistency invariants`

Yggdrasil varify it.

If (pass): compile

else(fail): visualizer => counter example

##Key contributions

Basic idea is to justify whether specification F_0 is equavalent to implementation F_1 (any to any mapping)

This is too strong(not account non-determnism like reorderings, crashes)

`Crash Refinement` : F_1 to F_0 (any to some mapping)
##Strength
* counter-example based debugging is better than Proof
* The specification are succinct, expressive,and free of implementation => reusable
