#EbbRT: A Framework for Building Per-Application Library Operating Systems

## prblem:
We do not need the OS to provide pretection and isolation. Reason: Genearl purpose operating system has overhead for per-app performance.

##EbbRT
It is a set of components, Ebbs, that developer can use and assemble together an application.

Pretty much like the SDN layers.

* Low-level event-driven exe environment
* Heterogeneous distributed system architecture
* Elastic building blocks

They show an exmaple of how EbbRt can be more efficient compared with Linux Memchached.
