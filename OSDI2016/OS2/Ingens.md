#Coordinated and Efficient Huge Page Management with Ingens
##Problem

High address translation cost

##Traditional solution:
Huge pages improve TLB coverage

However, it has high page fault latency, memory bloating etc.

##Ingens

* page fault latency

Ingens use asynchronous allocation, the page fault handler only assign base page, and put huge page allocation in background.

* Memory Bloating

Ingens monitor spatial uitlization of each huge page region, and enable utilization based allocation.

##What we can learn the design philosophy
* Reduce Latency => put high latency work into background
* Find more space => find assign unit, Check whether it is fully used. If not, try to fully utilize it.
