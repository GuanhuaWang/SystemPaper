#Network Requirements for Resource Disaggregation
## problem

Dats center speed increasing has slow down. Big company tries new disaggregate datacenter (DDC).

##Key finding for DDC
1. Network bandwidth in the range of 40-100 Gbps is sufficient to maintian application level performance 
2. Network latency in the range of 3-5 us is needed to maintain application level perforamnce
3. the bottleneck or root of bandwidth & latnecy is the applications memory bandwidth demand.
4. disaggregation at datacenter scale is feasible.
5. TPC/DCTCP fails to meet the target requirement.
