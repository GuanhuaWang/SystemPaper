#Efficient Network Reachability Analysis using a Succinct Control Plane Representation

## problem

It is not easy to do network verification (e.g. whether A can talk to B or not). 

Reason: new route announcements arrivial , links fails etc.

##ERA
directly reason about the network control plane,and can be scaled.
